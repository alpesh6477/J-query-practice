        Existence is the state of having being or reality. It is often contrasted with essence, since one can understand
        the essential features of something without knowing whether it exists. Ontology studies existence and
        differentiates between singular existence of individual entities and general existence of concepts or
        universals. Entities present in space and time have concrete existence, in contrast to abstract entities, like
        numbers and sets. Other distinctions are between possible, contingent, and necessary existence and between
        physical and mental existence. Some philosophers talk of degrees of existence but the more common view is that
        an entity either exists or not, with no intermediary states. It is controversial whether existence can be
        understood as a property of individual objects and, if so, whether there are nonexistent objects. The concept of
        existence has a long history and played a role in the ancient period in pre-Socratic, Hindu, Buddhist, and
        Daoist philosophy. (Full article...)
